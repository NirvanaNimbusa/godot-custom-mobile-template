Godot Custom Mobile Template
==========

I'll make available here the compiled Android templates with the modules I use on my [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/) projects, which are:

- [Godot Admob](https://github.com/kloder-games/godot-admob)
- [Godot Share](https://github.com/Shin-NiL/Godot-Share)
- [Godot Mobile Vibration](https://github.com/Shin-NiL/Godot-Mobile-Vibration)


My intention is to only make available the templates of the **stable Godot versions**.

If this project is helpful to you, please consider making a donation ;)

Just because I don't have a Mac OS do compile the template. If you can do that and want to share it with us, please send a message ;)
